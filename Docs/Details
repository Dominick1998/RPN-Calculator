Assignment 1.4
Detailed Report 

The program that I created is written in Java, which is why all classes of 
the io package are imported. I chose to write this simulator using Java 
Script as I am familiar with the language, and it is effective in handling
computations in reverse polish notation. Functionality includes simple 
arithmetic operations (e.g.,+,-,*/), and simple trigonometric functions
(e.g., sin, cos, tan). Grouping of expressions using parentheses is also a
function. This program uses standard tools for creating and handling 
syntax analysis and parsing such as lex(1) and yacc(1). The Java util 
package was imported in order to access the collection of framework, 
collection classes related to date and time, utility classes, event model, 
etc. Yacc(Yet another compiler-compiler) is a computer program for the 
Unix operating system. It is a look ahead left-right parser generator. 
This generates a LALR parser based on a formal grammar. Lex is a 
computer program that generates lexical analyzers. Lex and Yacc are 
commonly used together.

Examples of Infix notation to Reverse Polish Notation:
Infix                             RPN
A + B                             A B +
((1 + 2) / 3) ^ 4                 1 2 + 3 / 4 ^
(1 + 2) * (3 / 4) ^ (5 + 6)       1 2 + 3 4 / 5 6 + ^ *
Reverse Polish notation, which is also known as Polish postfix notation, 
is a mathematical notation in which operators follow operands, in 
contrast to Polish notation where operators precede their operands.
RPN has been found to make faster calculations.

parenthesized, which means fewer operations need to be 
entered to perform typical calculations. Kasprzyk, D. M.; Drury, Colin
